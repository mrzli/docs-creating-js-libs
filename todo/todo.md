- make publish work
  - update test
    - make tests use babel-jest instead of ts-jest
    - try it out in 'path' project
    - next, update jest-config project
    - next update project generator to use babel-jest
      - you will at least have to change dependencies, maybe the rest will remain the same if hidden inside jest-config project
      - you will need babel config, see path project
  - update project generator to use new publish
