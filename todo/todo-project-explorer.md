- idea
  - project explorer would be a tool for managing my projects
  - it would allow an overview of my projects, and would allow me to run tooling on them
- defining project set
  - I could use a glob list of directories which would be searched for projects
    - we should allow negative glob to exclude anything unwanted
    - project would be identified by having a project.json or (fallback) a package.json file
    - project.json should contain:
      - the project type (shared library, node library, ...)
      - labels
        - possibly this could supersede the project type, and would have relevant project information
      - possibly project version
        - it could possibly be used in migration to new project structure
        - new version would coincide with changes in project generator
        - although it is difficult to say how this would be useful considering that the project can be easily modified outside of the version, and be out of sync with it
  - projects could be searched by label etc
- we should allow seeing the project structure
  - maybe, depending on how easy this is to do
- allow opening of project in vscode
- later on allow project comparison
  - maybe do this soon, and just use an existing app, and open it directly from project (if such app allow terminal activation with folder specification up front)
- allow seing git statuses of all projects
